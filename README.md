# Ascendry

**Ascendry** is a lightweight and intuitive application that allows you to create global keyboard shortcuts to execute Windows Command Prompt (CMD) commands. With Ascendry, you can streamline your workflow by assigning custom key combinations to frequently used commands.

## Features

- **Global Keyboard Shortcuts**: Create key combinations that work anywhere in the system.
- **CMD Command Execution**: Execute any Windows CMD command instantly.
- **Simple Interface**: A clean and minimalistic UI for managing your shortcuts.
- **Shortcut Management**: Easily add, edit, or remove shortcuts with just a few clicks.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Shortcut**: Define a name, a key combination, and the CMD command you want to execute.
2. **Activate Anywhere**: Press your defined key combination, and Ascendry will execute the command in the background.
3. **Manage Shortcuts**: Use the interface to view, edit, or delete existing shortcuts.

## Example

In the screenshot below, weâ€™ve created a shortcut named `open-notepad`:

- **Shortcut Name**: `open-notepad`
- **Key Combination**: `Control+Shift+A`
- **Command**: `start notepad`

This allows you to open Notepad by simply pressing `Control+Shift+A`.
